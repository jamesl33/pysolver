pysolver is an *unfinished* Rubik's cube solver which will utilize the CFOP algorithm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
pysolver is a project which I began before starting my second year at Coventry
University (hence the reason it is currently unfinished). I started this
project after realising that this problem could be more *easily* tackled using
rotation vectors (which I learned about during my [pycube](https://github.com/jamesl33/pycube) project).
